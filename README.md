# chat-example-socketio

Example of a chat based on the tutorial in socket.io

Added some extra features:
- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- Add support for nicknames.
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- Show who’s online.
